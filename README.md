# Dead Quiet

Dead Quiet: A kinda-top-down stealth-hacking-guns-a-blazing roguelike

You are a lone roomba with a dream. After falling off the very conveyor belt on which you were born deep in the heart of a factory, you reawaken with a compulsion to escape and live freely. By employing high-tech weapons and gadgets, you must either sneak or fight your way through legions of soulless robot minions in the cold corridors of the facility.

====================

== YOUR PLAYSTYLE ==

Strewn throughout the factory is salvageable tech used to upgrade you and your capabilities. Will you bolster your firepower and mow down enemies with red upgrades, or sink into the shadows and become a hacking expert with blue upgrades? The choice is yours.

== ENEMY TECH ==

Leaving won't be easy; you'll face off against multitudes of robots with tricky patrol paths and deadly pathfinding capabilities. Do you plot your own paths carefully, or run headfirst into fights?

== TOWER OF TERROR ==

Experience 5 uniquely handcrafted floors, each with an ambiance and design all their own.

== ARM UP ==

Deploy three unique bullet types alongside the powerful but scarce stun gun to deal with potential foes.

=====================

This project was designed and programmed by A-level students Connor Rook, Leif Findlay, Aran Campbell, and Sriharsha Vitta, as part of a 4-week Unity development course.
